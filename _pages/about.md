My academic journey began at Sharif University of Technology (NAU), where I obtained my BSc. Mechanical Engineering. Throughout my undergraduate years, I had the chance to explore a range of research subjects, but the computational fluid dyanmics with core of understanding physics and programming became of my highest interest. That interes took me to Northern Arizona University (NAU) where I earned my MSc in Mechanical Engineering. My research ...
My academic journey began at Sun Yat-Sen University, where I earned a B.Eng. degree in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. Throughout my undergraduate years, I had the chance to explore a range of research subjects. I delved into optimizing methods for detecting structural damage and also immersed myself in simulating two-dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection. This latter experience notably sparked my interest in computational fluid dynamics. Parallel to my academic pursuits, I've enjoyed stargazing as a hobby since my middle school days. Fortunately, my path led me to the CFD lab at UC Berkeley, where my two passions seamlessly fused into research projects that perfectly align with my interests.

Currently, I am a Phd student at the University of Michigan, where I was fortunate to be advised by Aaron Towne. My research lies at the intersection of fluid dynamics, modal analysis, and high perfomance computing. I developed an efficient algorithm to compute resolvent modes of high dimaneiosnla systems, targeting three-dimanesional flows. After a succesful
